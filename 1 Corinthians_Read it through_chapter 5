<div class="bibleTextDiv">
    
    
    <span class="verseNumber">1</span>It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and such sexual immorality as is not even named among the Gentiles, that one has his father’s wife. <span class="verseNumber">2</span>You are arrogant, and didn’t mourn instead, that he who had done this deed might be removed from among you. <span class="verseNumber">3</span>For I most certainly, as being absent in body but present in spirit, have already, as though I were present, judged him who has done this thing. <span class="verseNumber">4</span>In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, you being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, <span class="verseNumber">5</span>are to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
    
    <span class="verseNumber">6</span>Your boasting is not good. Don’t you know that a little yeast leavens the whole lump? <span class="verseNumber">7</span>Purge out the old yeast, that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened. For indeed Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed in our place. <span class="verseNumber">8</span>Therefore let’s keep the feast, not with old yeast, neither with the yeast of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
    
    <span class="verseNumber">9</span>I wrote to you in my letter to have no company with sexual sinners; <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">0</span>yet not at all meaning with the sexual sinners of this world, or with the covetous and extortionists, or with idolaters; for then you would have to leave the world. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">1</span>But as it is, I wrote to you not to associate with anyone who is called a brother who is a sexual sinner, or covetous, or an idolater, or a slanderer, or a drunkard, or an extortionist. Don’t even eat with such a person. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">2</span>For what do I have to do with also judging those who are outside? Don’t you judge those who are within? <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">3</span>But those who are outside, God judges. “Put away the wicked man from among yourselves.”
    
    
    
    
    
    <div class="chapterNumberDiv"><span class=chapterNumberSpan>Chapter Six</span></div>
    
    <span class="verseNumber">1</span>Dare any of you, having a matter against his neighbor, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the saints? <span class="verseNumber">2</span>Don’t you know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters? <span class="verseNumber">3</span>Don’t you know that we will judge angels? How much more, things that pertain to this life? <span class="verseNumber">4</span>If then you have to judge things pertaining to this life, do you set them to judge who are of no account in the assembly? <span class="verseNumber">5</span>I say this to move you to shame. Isn’t there even one wise man among you who would be able to decide between his brothers? <span class="verseNumber">6</span>But brother goes to law with brother, and that before unbelievers! <span class="verseNumber">7</span>Therefore it is already altogether a defect in you, that you have lawsuits one with another. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded? <span class="verseNumber">8</span>No, but you yourselves do wrong and defraud, and that against your brothers. <span class="verseNumber">9</span>Or don’t you know that the unrighteous will not inherit God’s Kingdom? Don’t be deceived. Neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor male prostitutes, nor homosexuals, <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">0</span>nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor slanderers, nor extortionists, will inherit God’s Kingdom. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">1</span>Some of you were such, but you were washed. But you were sanctified. But you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and in the Spirit of our God.
    
    <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">2</span>“All things are lawful for me,” but not all things are expedient. “All things are lawful for me,” but I will not be brought under the power of anything. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">3</span>“Foods for the belly, and the belly for foods,” but God will bring to nothing both it and them. But the body is not for sexual immorality, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">4</span>Now God raised up the Lord, and will also raise us up by his power. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">5</span>Don’t you know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? May it never be! <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">6</span>Or don’t you know that he who is joined to a prostitute is one body? For, “The two”, he says, “will become one flesh.” <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">7</span>But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">8</span>Flee sexual immorality! “Every sin that a man does is outside the body,” but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">9</span>Or don’t you know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God? You are not your own, <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">0</span>for you were bought with a price. Therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God’s.
    
    
    
    
    
    <div class="chapterNumberDiv"><span class=chapterNumberSpan>Chapter Seven</span></div>
    
    <span class="verseNumber">1</span>Now concerning the things about which you wrote to me: it is good for a man not to touch a woman. <span class="verseNumber">2</span>But, because of sexual immoralities, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband. <span class="verseNumber">3</span>Let the husband give his wife the affection owed her, and likewise also the wife her husband. <span class="verseNumber">4</span>The wife doesn’t have authority over her own body, but the husband. Likewise also the husband doesn’t have authority over his own body, but the wife. <span class="verseNumber">5</span>Don’t deprive one another, unless it is by consent for a season, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer, and may be together again, that Satan doesn’t tempt you because of your lack of self-control.
    
    <span class="verseNumber">6</span>But this I say by way of concession, not of commandment. <span class="verseNumber">7</span>Yet I wish that all men were like me. However each man has his own gift from God, one of this kind, and another of that kind. <span class="verseNumber">8</span>But I say to the unmarried and to widows, it is good for them if they remain even as I am. <span class="verseNumber">9</span>But if they don’t have self-control, let them marry. For it’s better to marry than to burn. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">0</span>But to the married I command—not I, but the Lord—that the wife not leave her husband <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">1</span>(but if she departs, let her remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband), and that the husband not leave his wife.
    
    <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">2</span>But to the rest I—not the Lord—say, if any brother has an unbelieving wife, and she is content to live with him, let him not leave her. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">3</span>The woman who has an unbelieving husband, and he is content to live with her, let her not leave her husband. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">4</span>For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but now they are holy. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">5</span>Yet if the unbeliever departs, let there be separation. The brother or the sister is not under bondage in such cases, but God has called us in peace. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">6</span>For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife? <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">7</span>Only, as the Lord has distributed to each man, as God has called each, so let him walk. So I command in all the assemblies.
    
    <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">8</span>Was anyone called having been circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Has anyone been called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">9</span>Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">0</span>Let each man stay in that calling in which he was called. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">1</span>Were you called being a bondservant? Don’t let that bother you, but if you get an opportunity to become free, use it. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">2</span>For he who was called in the Lord being a bondservant is the Lord’s free man. Likewise he who was called being free is Christ’s bondservant. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">3</span>You were bought with a price. Don’t become bondservants of men. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">4</span>Brothers, let each man, in whatever condition he was called, stay in that condition with God.
    
    <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">5</span>Now concerning virgins, I have no commandment from the Lord, but I give my judgment as one who has obtained mercy from the Lord to be trustworthy. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">6</span>Therefore I think that because of the distress that is on us, that it’s good for a man to remain as he is. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">7</span>Are you bound to a wife? Don’t seek to be freed. Are you free from a wife? Don’t seek a wife. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">8</span>But if you marry, you have not sinned. If a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Yet such will have oppression in the flesh, and I want to spare you. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">9</span>But I say this, brothers: the time is short, that from now on, both those who have wives may be as though they had none; <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">0</span>and those who weep, as though they didn’t weep; and those who rejoice, as though they didn’t rejoice; and those who buy, as though they didn’t possess; <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">1</span>and those who use the world, as not using it to the fullest. For the mode of this world passes away. <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">2</span>But I desire to have you to be free from cares. He who is unmarried is concerned for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord; <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">3</span>but he who is married is concerned about the things of the world, how he may please his wife. <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">4</span>There is also a difference between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she who is married cares about the things of the world—how she may please her husband. <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">5</span>This I say for your own profit; not that I may ensnare you, but for that which is appropriate, and that you may attend to the Lord without distraction. <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">6</span>But if any man thinks that he is behaving inappropriately toward his virgin, if she is past the flower of her age, and if need so requires, let him do what he desires. He doesn’t sin. Let them marry. <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">7</span>But he who stands steadfast in his heart, having no urgency, but has power over his own will, and has determined in his own heart to keep his own virgin, does well. <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">8</span>So then both he who gives his own virgin in marriage does well, and he who doesn’t give her in marriage does better.
    
    <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">9</span>A wife is bound by law for as long as her husband lives; but if the husband is dead, she is free to be married to whomever she desires, only in the Lord. <span class="verseNumber">4</span><span class="verseNumber">0</span>But she is happier if she stays as she is, in my judgment, and I think that I also have God’s Spirit.
    
    
    
    <div class="chapterNumberDiv"><span class=chapterNumberSpan>Chapter Eight</span></div>

    <span class="verseNumber">1</span>Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up. <span class="verseNumber">2</span>But if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he doesn’t yet know as he ought to know. <span class="verseNumber">3</span>But if anyone loves God, the same is known by him. <span class="verseNumber">4</span>Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the world, and that there is no other God but one. <span class="verseNumber">5</span>For though there are things that are called “gods”, whether in the heavens or on earth; as there are many “gods” and many “lords”; <span class="verseNumber">6</span>yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we live through him. <span class="verseNumber">7</span>However, that knowledge isn’t in all men. But some, with consciousness of the idol until now, eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled. <span class="verseNumber">8</span>But food will not commend us to God. For neither, if we don’t eat, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better. <span class="verseNumber">9</span>But be careful that by no means does this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to the weak. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">0</span>For if a man sees you who have knowledge sitting in an idol’s temple, won’t his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols? <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">1</span>And through your knowledge, he who is weak perishes, the brother for whose sake Christ died. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">2</span>Thus, sinning against the brothers, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">3</span>Therefore if food causes my brother to stumble, I will eat no meat forever more, that I don’t cause my brother to stumble.
    
    
    
    
    
    <div class="chapterNumberDiv"><span class=chapterNumberSpan>Chapter Nine</span></div>

    <span class="verseNumber">1</span>Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Haven’t I seen Jesus Christ, our Lord? Aren’t you my work in the Lord? <span class="verseNumber">2</span>If to others I am not an apostle, yet at least I am to you; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord. <span class="verseNumber">3</span>My defense to those who examine me is this: <span class="verseNumber">4</span>Have we no right to eat and to drink? <span class="verseNumber">5</span>Have we no right to take along a wife who is a believer, even as the rest of the apostles, and the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas? <span class="verseNumber">6</span>Or have only Barnabas and I no right to not work? <span class="verseNumber">7</span>What soldier ever serves at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard, and doesn’t eat of its fruit? Or who feeds a flock, and doesn’t drink from the flock’s milk? <span class="verseNumber">8</span>Do I speak these things according to the ways of men? Or doesn’t the law also say the same thing? <span class="verseNumber">9</span>For it is written in the law of Moses, “You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain.” Is it for the oxen that God cares, <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">0</span>or does he say it assuredly for our sake? Yes, it was written for our sake, because he who plows ought to plow in hope, and he who threshes in hope should partake of his hope. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">1</span>If we sowed to you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we reap your fleshly things? <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">2</span>If others partake of this right over you, don’t we yet more? Nevertheless we didn’t use this right, but we bear all things, that we may cause no hindrance to the Good News of Christ. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">3</span>Don’t you know that those who serve around sacred things eat from the things of the temple, and those who wait on the altar have their portion with the altar? <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">4</span>Even so the Lord ordained that those who proclaim the Good News should live from the Good News. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">5</span>But I have used none of these things, and I don’t write these things that it may be done so in my case; for I would rather die, than that anyone should make my boasting void. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">6</span>For if I preach the Good News, I have nothing to boast about; for necessity is laid on me; but woe is to me if I don’t preach the Good News. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">7</span>For if I do this of my own will, I have a reward. But if not of my own will, I have a stewardship entrusted to me. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">8</span>What then is my reward? That when I preach the Good News, I may present the Good News of Christ without charge, so as not to abuse my authority in the Good News. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">9</span>For though I was free from all, I brought myself under bondage to all, that I might gain the more. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">0</span>To the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to those who are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain those who are under the law; <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">1</span>to those who are without law, as without law (not being without law toward God, but under law toward Christ), that I might win those who are without law. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">2</span>To the weak I became as weak, that I might gain the weak. I have become all things to all men, that I may by all means save some. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">3</span>Now I do this for the sake of the Good News, that I may be a joint partaker of it. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">4</span>Don’t you know that those who run in a race all run, but one receives the prize? Run like that, that you may win. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">5</span>Every man who strives in the games exercises self-control in all things. Now they do it to receive a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">6</span>I therefore run like that, not aimlessly. I fight like that, not beating the air, <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">7</span>but I beat my body and bring it into submission, lest by any means, after I have preached to others, I myself should be rejected.
    
   

   
    <div class="chapterNumberDiv"><span class=chapterNumberSpan>Chapter Ten</span></div>

    <span class="verseNumber">1</span>Now I would not have you ignorant, brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; <span class="verseNumber">2</span>and were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea; <span class="verseNumber">3</span>and all ate the same spiritual food; <span class="verseNumber">4</span>and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ. <span class="verseNumber">5</span>However with most of them, God was not well pleased, for they were overthrown in the wilderness. <span class="verseNumber">6</span>Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted. <span class="verseNumber">7</span>Don’t be idolaters, as some of them were. As it is written, “The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.” <span class="verseNumber">8</span>Let’s not commit sexual immorality, as some of them committed, and in one day twenty-three thousand fell. <span class="verseNumber">9</span>Let’s not test Christ, as some of them tested, and perished by the serpents. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">0</span>Don’t grumble, as some of them also grumbled, and perished by the destroyer. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">1</span>Now all these things happened to them by way of example, and they were written for our admonition, on whom the ends of the ages have come. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">2</span>Therefore let him who thinks he stands be careful that he doesn’t fall.
    
    <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">3</span>No temptation has taken you except what is common to man. God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted above what you are able, but will with the temptation also make the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.
    
    <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">4</span>Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">5</span>I speak as to wise men. Judge what I say. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">6</span>The cup of blessing which we bless, isn’t it a sharing of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, isn’t it a sharing of the body of Christ? <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">7</span>Because there is one loaf of bread, we, who are many, are one body; for we all partake of the one loaf of bread. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">8</span>Consider Israel according to the flesh. Don’t those who eat the sacrifices participate in the altar?
    
    <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">9</span>What am I saying then? That a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything? <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">0</span>But I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God, and I don’t desire that you would have fellowship with demons. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">1</span>You can’t both drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You can’t both partake of the table of the Lord and of the table of demons. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">2</span>Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he?
    
    <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">3</span>“All things are lawful for me,” but not all things are profitable. “All things are lawful for me,” but not all things build up. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">4</span>Let no one seek his own, but each one his neighbor’s good. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">5</span>Whatever is sold in the butcher shop, eat, asking no question for the sake of conscience, <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">6</span>for “the earth is the Lord’s, and its fullness.” <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">7</span>But if one of those who don’t believe invites you to a meal, and you are inclined to go, eat whatever is set before you, asking no questions for the sake of conscience. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">8</span>But if anyone says to you, “This was offered to idols,” don’t eat it for the sake of the one who told you, and for the sake of conscience. For “the earth is the Lord’s, with all its fullness.” <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">9</span>Conscience, I say, not your own, but the other’s conscience. For why is my liberty judged by another conscience? <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">0</span>If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced for something I give thanks for? <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">1</span>Whether therefore you eat, or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God. <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">2</span>Give no occasion for stumbling, whether to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the assembly of God; <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">3</span>even as I also please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of the many, that they may be saved.
    
    
    
    
    
    <div class="chapterNumberDiv"><span class=chapterNumberSpan>Chapter Eleven</span></div>

    <span class="verseNumber">1</span>Be imitators of me, even as I also am of Christ.
    
    <span class="verseNumber">2</span>Now I praise you, brothers, that you remember me in all things, and hold firm the traditions, even as I delivered them to you. <span class="verseNumber">3</span>But I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God. <span class="verseNumber">4</span>Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonors his head. <span class="verseNumber">5</span>But every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered dishonors her head. For it is one and the same thing as if she were shaved. <span class="verseNumber">6</span>For if a woman is not covered, let her hair also be cut off. But if it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut off or be shaved, let her be covered. <span class="verseNumber">7</span>For a man indeed ought not to have his head covered, because he is the image and glory of God, but the woman is the glory of the man. <span class="verseNumber">8</span>For man is not from woman, but woman from man; <span class="verseNumber">9</span>for man wasn’t created for the woman, but woman for the man. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">0</span>For this cause the woman ought to have authority over her own head, because of the angels.
    
    <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">1</span>Nevertheless, neither is the woman independent of the man, nor the man independent of the woman, in the Lord. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">2</span>For as woman came from man, so a man also comes through a woman; but all things are from God. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">3</span>Judge for yourselves. Is it appropriate that a woman pray to God unveiled? <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">4</span>Doesn’t even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him? <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">5</span>But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her, for her hair is given to her for a covering. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">6</span>But if any man seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither do God’s assemblies.
    
    <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">7</span>But in giving you this command, I don’t praise you, that you come together not for the better but for the worse. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">8</span>For first of all, when you come together in the assembly, I hear that divisions exist among you, and I partly believe it. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">9</span>For there also must be factions among you, that those who are approved may be revealed among you. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">0</span>When therefore you assemble yourselves together, it is not the Lord’s supper that you eat. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">1</span>For in your eating each one takes his own supper first. One is hungry, and another is drunken. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">2</span>What, don’t you have houses to eat and to drink in? Or do you despise God’s assembly and put them to shame who don’t have enough? What shall I tell you? Shall I praise you? In this I don’t praise you.
    
    <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">3</span>For I received from the Lord that which also I delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night in which he was betrayed took bread. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">4</span>When he had given thanks, he broke it and said, “Take, eat. This is my body, which is broken for you. Do this in memory of me.” <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">5</span>In the same way he also took the cup, after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink, in memory of me.” <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">6</span>For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">7</span>Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks the Lord’s cup in a way unworthy of the Lord will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">8</span>But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">9</span>For he who eats and drinks in an unworthy way eats and drinks judgment to himself if he doesn’t discern the Lord’s body. <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">0</span>For this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep. <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">1</span>For if we discerned ourselves, we wouldn’t be judged. <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">2</span>But when we are judged, we are punished by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world. <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">3</span>Therefore, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another. <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">4</span>But if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, lest your coming together be for judgment. The rest I will set in order whenever I come.
    
    
    
    
    <div class="chapterNumberDiv"><span class=chapterNumberSpan>Chapter Twelve</span></div>
    
    <span class="verseNumber">1</span>Now concerning spiritual things, brothers, I don’t want you to be ignorant. <span class="verseNumber">2</span>You know that when you were heathen, you were led away to those mute idols, however you might be led. <span class="verseNumber">3</span>Therefore I make known to you that no man speaking by God’s Spirit says, “Jesus is accursed.” No one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” but by the Holy Spirit.
    
    <span class="verseNumber">4</span>Now there are various kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit. <span class="verseNumber">5</span>There are various kinds of service, and the same Lord. <span class="verseNumber">6</span>There are various kinds of workings, but the same God, who works all things in all. <span class="verseNumber">7</span>But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the profit of all. <span class="verseNumber">8</span>For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom, and to another the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit; <span class="verseNumber">9</span>to another faith, by the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healings, by the same Spirit; <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">0</span>and to another workings of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discerning of spirits; to another different kinds of languages; and to another the interpretation of languages. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">1</span>But the one and the same Spirit produces all of these, distributing to each one separately as he desires.
    
    <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">2</span>For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">3</span>For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all given to drink into one Spirit. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">4</span>For the body is not one member, but many. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">5</span>If the foot would say, “Because I’m not the hand, I’m not part of the body,” it is not therefore not part of the body. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">6</span>If the ear would say, “Because I’m not the eye, I’m not part of the body,” it’s not therefore not part of the body. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">7</span>If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the smelling be? <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">8</span>But now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body, just as he desired. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">9</span>If they were all one member, where would the body be? <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">0</span>But now they are many members, but one body. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">1</span>The eye can’t tell the hand, “I have no need for you,” or again the head to the feet, “I have no need for you.” <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">2</span>No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">3</span>Those parts of the body which we think to be less honorable, on those we bestow more abundant honor; and our unpresentable parts have more abundant propriety; <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">4</span>whereas our presentable parts have no such need. But God composed the body together, giving more abundant honor to the inferior part, <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">5</span>that there should be no division in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">6</span>When one member suffers, all the members suffer with it. When one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.
    
    <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">7</span>Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">8</span>God has set some in the assembly: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracle workers, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, and various kinds of languages. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">9</span>Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all miracle workers? <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">0</span>Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak with various languages? Do all interpret? <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">1</span>But earnestly desire the best gifts. Moreover, I show a most excellent way to you.
    
    
    
    
    <div class="chapterNumberDiv"><span class=chapterNumberSpan>Chapter Thirteen</span></div>

    <span class="verseNumber">1</span>If I speak with the languages of men and of angels, but don’t have love, I have become sounding brass, or a clanging cymbal. <span class="verseNumber">2</span>If I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but don’t have love, I am nothing. <span class="verseNumber">3</span>If I give away all my goods to feed the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, but don’t have love, it profits me nothing.
    
    <span class="verseNumber">4</span>Love is patient and is kind. Love doesn’t envy. Love doesn’t brag, is not proud, <span class="verseNumber">5</span>doesn’t behave itself inappropriately, doesn’t seek its own way, is not provoked, takes no account of evil; <span class="verseNumber">6</span>doesn’t rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; <span class="verseNumber">7</span>bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, and endures all things. <span class="verseNumber">8</span>Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will be done away with. Where there are various languages, they will cease. Where there is knowledge, it will be done away with. <span class="verseNumber">9</span>For we know in part and we prophesy in part; <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">0</span>but when that which is complete has come, then that which is partial will be done away with. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">1</span>When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I felt as a child, I thought as a child. Now that I have become a man, I have put away childish things. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">2</span>For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know fully, even as I was also fully known. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">3</span>But now faith, hope, and love remain—these three. The greatest of these is love.
    
    
    
    
    
    <div class="chapterNumberDiv"><span class=chapterNumberSpan>Chapter Fourteen</span></div>

    <span class="verseNumber">1</span>Follow after love and earnestly desire spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy. <span class="verseNumber">2</span>For he who speaks in another language speaks not to men, but to God; for no one understands; but in the Spirit he speaks mysteries. <span class="verseNumber">3</span>But he who prophesies speaks to men for their edification, exhortation, and consolation. <span class="verseNumber">4</span>He who speaks in another language edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the assembly. <span class="verseNumber">5</span>Now I desire to have you all speak with other languages, but rather that you would prophesy. For he is greater who prophesies than he who speaks with other languages, unless he interprets, that the assembly may be built up.
    
    <span class="verseNumber">6</span>But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking with other languages, what would I profit you, unless I speak to you either by way of revelation, or of knowledge, or of prophesying, or of teaching? <span class="verseNumber">7</span>Even things without life, giving a voice, whether pipe or harp, if they didn’t give a distinction in the sounds, how would it be known what is piped or harped? <span class="verseNumber">8</span>For if the trumpet gave an uncertain sound, who would prepare himself for war? <span class="verseNumber">9</span>So also you, unless you uttered by the tongue words easy to understand, how would it be known what is spoken? For you would be speaking into the air. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">0</span>There are, it may be, so many kinds of languages in the world, and none of them is without meaning. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">1</span>If then I don’t know the meaning of the language, I would be to him who speaks a foreigner, and he who speaks would be a foreigner to me. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">2</span>So also you, since you are zealous for spiritual gifts, seek that you may abound to the building up of the assembly. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">3</span>Therefore let him who speaks in another language pray that he may interpret. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">4</span>For if I pray in another language, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful.
    
    <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">5</span>What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also. I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">6</span>Otherwise if you bless with the spirit, how will he who fills the place of the unlearned say the “Amen” at your giving of thanks, seeing he doesn’t know what you say? <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">7</span>For you most certainly give thanks well, but the other person is not built up. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">8</span>I thank my God, I speak with other languages more than you all. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">9</span>However in the assembly I would rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in another language.
    
    <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">0</span>Brothers, don’t be children in thoughts, yet in malice be babies, but in thoughts be mature. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">1</span>In the law it is written, “By men of strange languages and by the lips of strangers I will speak to this people. They won’t even hear me that way, says the Lord.” <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">2</span>Therefore other languages are for a sign, not to those who believe, but to the unbelieving; but prophesying is for a sign, not to the unbelieving, but to those who believe. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">3</span>If therefore the whole assembly is assembled together and all speak with other languages, and unlearned or unbelieving people come in, won’t they say that you are crazy? <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">4</span>But if all prophesy, and someone unbelieving or unlearned comes in, he is reproved by all, and he is judged by all. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">5</span>And thus the secrets of his heart are revealed. So he will fall down on his face and worship God, declaring that God is among you indeed.
    
    <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">6</span>What is it then, brothers? When you come together, each one of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has another language, or has an interpretation. Let all things be done to build each other up. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">7</span>If any man speaks in another language, let it be two, or at the most three, and in turn; and let one interpret. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">8</span>But if there is no interpreter, let him keep silent in the assembly, and let him speak to himself, and to God. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">9</span>Let the prophets speak, two or three, and let the others discern. <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">0</span>But if a revelation is made to another sitting by, let the first keep silent. <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">1</span>For you all can prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be exhorted. <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">2</span>The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets, <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">3</span>for God is not a God of confusion, but of peace, as in all the assemblies of the saints. <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">4</span>Let the wives be quiet in the assemblies, for it has not been permitted for them to be talking except in submission, as the law also says, <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">5</span>if they desire to learn anything. “Let them ask their own husbands at home, for it is shameful for a wife to be talking in the assembly.” <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">6</span>What!? Was it from you that the word of God went out? Or did it come to you alone?
    
    <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">7</span>If any man thinks himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him recognize the things which I write to you, that they are the commandment of the Lord. <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">8</span>But if anyone is ignorant, let him be ignorant.
    
    <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">9</span>Therefore, brothers, desire earnestly to prophesy, and don’t forbid speaking with other languages. <span class="verseNumber">4</span><span class="verseNumber">0</span>Let all things be done decently and in order.
    
    
    
    
    
    <div class="chapterNumberDiv"><span class=chapterNumberSpan>Chapter Fifteen</span></div>

    <span class="verseNumber">1</span>Now I declare to you, brothers, the Good News which I preached to you, which also you received, in which you also stand, <span class="verseNumber">2</span>by which also you are saved, if you hold firmly the word which I preached to you—unless you believed in vain. <span class="verseNumber">3</span>For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, <span class="verseNumber">4</span>that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, <span class="verseNumber">5</span>and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. <span class="verseNumber">6</span>Then he appeared to over five hundred brothers at once, most of whom remain until now, but some have also fallen asleep. <span class="verseNumber">7</span>Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles, <span class="verseNumber">8</span>and last of all, as to the child born at the wrong time, he appeared to me also. <span class="verseNumber">9</span>For I am the least of the apostles, who is not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the assembly of God. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">0</span>But by the grace of God I am what I am. His grace which was given to me was not futile, but I worked more than all of them; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">1</span>Whether then it is I or they, so we preach, and so you believed.
    
    <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">2</span>Now if Christ is preached, that he has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">3</span>But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither has Christ been raised. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">4</span>If Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain, and your faith also is in vain. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">5</span>Yes, we are also found false witnesses of God, because we testified about God that he raised up Christ, whom he didn’t raise up, if it is so that the dead are not raised. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">6</span>For if the dead aren’t raised, neither has Christ been raised. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">7</span>If Christ has not been raised, your faith is vain; you are still in your sins. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">8</span>Then they also who are fallen asleep in Christ have perished. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">9</span>If we have only hoped in Christ in this life, we are of all men most pitiable.
    
    <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">0</span>But now Christ has been raised from the dead. He became the first fruit of those who are asleep. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">1</span>For since death came by man, the resurrection of the dead also came by man. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">2</span>For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">3</span>But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, then those who are Christ’s, at his coming. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">4</span>Then the end comes, when he will deliver up the Kingdom to God, even the Father, when he will have abolished all rule and all authority and power. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">5</span>For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">6</span>The last enemy that will be abolished is death. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">7</span>For, “He put all things in subjection under his feet.”Psalm <span class="verseNumber">8</span>:<span class="verseNumber">6</span>But when he says, “All things are put in subjection”, it is evident that he is excepted who subjected all things to him. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">8</span>When all things have been subjected to him, then the Son will also himself be subjected to him who subjected all things to him, that God may be all in all.
    
    <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">9</span>Or else what will they do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead aren’t raised at all, why then are they baptized for the dead? <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">0</span>Why do we also stand in jeopardy every hour? <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">1</span>I affirm, by the boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily. <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">2</span>If I fought with animals at Ephesus for human purposes, what does it profit me? If the dead are not raised, then “let’s eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.” <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">3</span>Don’t be deceived! “Evil companionships corrupt good morals.” <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">4</span>Wake up righteously, and don’t sin, for some have no knowledge of God. I say this to your shame.
    
    <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">5</span>But someone will say, “How are the dead raised?” and, “With what kind of body do they come?” <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">6</span>You foolish one, that which you yourself sow is not made alive unless it dies. <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">7</span>That which you sow, you don’t sow the body that will be, but a bare grain, maybe of wheat, or of some other kind. <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">8</span>But God gives it a body even as it pleased him, and to each seed a body of its own. <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">9</span>All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one flesh of men, another flesh of animals, another of fish, and another of birds. <span class="verseNumber">4</span><span class="verseNumber">0</span>There are also celestial bodies and terrestrial bodies; but the glory of the celestial differs from that of the terrestrial. <span class="verseNumber">4</span><span class="verseNumber">1</span>There is one glory of the sun, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differs from another star in glory. <span class="verseNumber">4</span><span class="verseNumber">2</span>So also is the resurrection of the dead. The body is sown perishable; it is raised imperishable. <span class="verseNumber">4</span><span class="verseNumber">3</span>It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power. <span class="verseNumber">4</span><span class="verseNumber">4</span>It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body and there is also a spiritual body.
    
    <span class="verseNumber">4</span><span class="verseNumber">5</span>So also it is written, “The first man, Adam, became a living soul.” The last Adam became a life-giving spirit. <span class="verseNumber">4</span><span class="verseNumber">6</span>However that which is spiritual isn’t first, but that which is natural, then that which is spiritual. <span class="verseNumber">4</span><span class="verseNumber">7</span>The first man is of the earth, made of dust. The second man is the Lord from heaven. <span class="verseNumber">4</span><span class="verseNumber">8</span>As is the one made of dust, such are those who are also made of dust; and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly. <span class="verseNumber">4</span><span class="verseNumber">9</span>As we have borne the image of those made of dust, let’s also bear the image of the heavenly. <span class="verseNumber">5</span><span class="verseNumber">0</span>Now I say this, brothers, that flesh and blood can’t inherit God’s Kingdom; neither does the perishable inherit imperishable.
    
    <span class="verseNumber">5</span><span class="verseNumber">1</span>Behold, I tell you a mystery. We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed, <span class="verseNumber">5</span><span class="verseNumber">2</span>in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we will be changed. <span class="verseNumber">5</span><span class="verseNumber">3</span>For this perishable body must become imperishable, and this mortal must put on immortality. <span class="verseNumber">5</span><span class="verseNumber">4</span>But when this perishable body will have become imperishable, and this mortal will have put on immortality, then what is written will happen: “Death is swallowed up in victory.”
    
    <span class="verseNumber">5</span><span class="verseNumber">5</span>“Death, where is your sting?
        Hades, where is your victory?”
    
    <span class="verseNumber">5</span><span class="verseNumber">6</span>The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. <span class="verseNumber">5</span><span class="verseNumber">7</span>But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. <span class="verseNumber">5</span><span class="verseNumber">8</span>Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the Lord’s work, because you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.

    <span class="verseNumber">1</span>Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I commanded the assemblies of Galatia, you do likewise. <span class="verseNumber">2</span>On the first day of every week, let each one of you save, as he may prosper, that no collections are made when I come. <span class="verseNumber">3</span>When I arrive, I will send whoever you approve with letters to carry your gracious gift to Jerusalem. <span class="verseNumber">4</span>If it is appropriate for me to go also, they will go with me. <span class="verseNumber">5</span>But I will come to you when I have passed through Macedonia, for I am passing through Macedonia. <span class="verseNumber">6</span>But with you it may be that I will stay, or even winter, that you may send me on my journey wherever I go. <span class="verseNumber">7</span>For I do not wish to see you now in passing, but I hope to stay a while with you, if the Lord permits. <span class="verseNumber">8</span>But I will stay at Ephesus until Pentecost, <span class="verseNumber">9</span>for a great and effective door has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.
    
    <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">0</span>Now if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without fear, for he does the work of the Lord, as I also do. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">1</span>Therefore let no one despise him. But set him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come to me; for I expect him with the brothers.
    
    <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">2</span>Now concerning Apollos, the brother, I strongly urged him to come to you with the brothers; and it was not at all his desire to come now; but he will come when he has an opportunity.
    
    <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">3</span>Watch! Stand firm in the faith! Be courageous! Be strong! <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">4</span>Let all that you do be done in love.
    
    <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">5</span>Now I beg you, brothers—you know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have set themselves to serve the saints— <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">6</span>that you also be in subjection to such, and to everyone who helps in the work and labors. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">7</span>I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus; for that which was lacking on your part, they supplied. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">8</span>For they refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore acknowledge those who are like that.
    
    <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">9</span>The assemblies of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla greet you much in the Lord, together with the assembly that is in their house. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">0</span>All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
    
    <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">1</span>This greeting is by me, Paul, with my own hand. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">2</span>If any man doesn’t love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be cursed. Come, Lord! <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">3</span>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">4</span>My love to all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen.
